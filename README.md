# GPT Embedding

### Introduction
Embeddings are a key component of GPT-4, as they allow the model to understand the meaning and context of words in a text. By representing words as vectors in a high-dimensional space, embeddings enable the model to perform complex natural language processing tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and language translation.
